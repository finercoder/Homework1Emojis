So Dr. Mohan wants to type out the message: "I am having a great time! :D" and he wants the emoji to be in unicode format. So he writes the message into a file, opens the java program emojis, inputs the file name and output file name, then recieves the outputed text file with the unicode.

So Dr. Bohner is really excited about competitive programming team and wants to express his excitement to Micha Taylor. Dr. Bohner is about to send his message saying "I am really excited! :D" but he then realizes Micha is picky about his emojis. He only wants them to be in unicode. So he finds the java program emojis.java to turn the :D to unicode. But after running the code on a file with the text, he realizes that their is no support for ":D". He gets angry,  but then realizes the programmer put in an easy way to integrate emojis into the code. So he adds it to the code. Runs it. Sends the message to Micha. Then realizes he accidentally sent it to the whole department.
